# Activity Options

Activities are the work units that run outside a Workflow and can perform
non-deterministic operations. Activity Options let you define how an activity
should run: timeouts, retries and other execution settings. These
options shape reliability and performance, making each activity call predictable
and consistent across SDKs. Configure them when invoking an activity to ensure
it behaves the way your Workflow expects.

:::tip
These are configured to provide sensible defaults which will work for most use
cases. In most scenarios, you probably won't need to configure this.

## Metadata

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `activityOptions` | [`ActivityOptions`](#types-activity-options) | `no` | Configure the activity options. If nothing is provided, the default options will be used. |

## Types

### ActivityOptions {#types-activity-options}

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| scheduleToCloseTimeout | [`duration`](../intro#duration) | `no` | - | Total time that a workflow is willing to wait for an Activity to complete |
| scheduleToStartTimeout | [`duration`](../intro#duration) | `no` | - | Time that the Activity Task can stay in the Task Queue before it is picked up by a Worker. Do not specify this timeout unless using host specific Task Queues for Activity Tasks are being used for routing |
| startToCloseTimeout | [`duration`](../intro#duration) | `no` | `{"minutes":5}` | Maximum time of a single Activity execution attempt |
| retryPolicy | [`RetryPolicy`](#types-retry-policy) | `no` | - | Specifies how to retry an Activity if an error occurs |
| disableEagerExecution | `boolean` | `no` | `false` | If `true`, eager execution will not be requested, regardless of worker settings. If `false`, eager execution may still be disabled at the worker level or may not be requested due to lack of available slots. |
| summary | `string` | `no` | The task's name | Add a summary to the Temporal workflow UI |
| priority | [`ActivityPriority`](#types-activity-priority) | `no` | - | Configure an activity's priority and fairness (pre-release) |

### ActivityPriority {#types-activity-priority}

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `priorityKey` | `integer` | `no` | - | A positive integer from 1 to _n_, where smaller integers correspond to higher priorities (tasks run sooner) |
| `fairnessKey` | `string` | `no` | - | A short string that's used as a key for a fairness balancing mechanism |
| `fairnessWeight` | `float` | `no` | - | Weight of a task can come from multiple sources for flexibility |

### RetryPolicy {#types-retry-policy}

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `initialInterval` | [`duration`](../intro#duration) | `no` | `{"second":1}` | Backoff interval for the first retry. If BackoffCoefficient is `1.0` then it is used for all retries |
| `backoffCoefficient` | `float` | `no` | `2.0` | Coefficient used to calculate the next retry backoff interval |
| `maximumInterval` | [`duration`](../intro#duration) | `no` | `{"minute":1}` | Maximum backoff interval between retries |
| `maximumAttempts` | `integer` | `no` | `5` | Maximum number of attempts. When exceeded the retries stop even if not expired yet |
| `nonRetryableErrorTypes` | `string[]` | `no` | `[]` | Temporal server will stop retry if error type matches this list |
