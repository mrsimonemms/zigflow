# Run

Provides the capability to run execute external commands

## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| run.container | [`container`](#container) | `no` | The definition of the container to run.<br />*Required if `script`, `shell` and `workflow` have not been set.* |
| run.script | [`script`](#script) | `no` | The definition of the script to run.<br />*Required if `container`, `shell` and `workflow` have not been set.* |
| run.shell | [`shell`](#shell) | `no` | The definition of the shell command to run.<br />*Required if `container`, `script` and `workflow` have not been set.* |
| run.workflow | [`workflow`](#workflow) | `no` | The definition of the workflow to run.<br />*Required if `container`, `script` and `shell` have not been set.* |
| await | `boolean` | `no` | Determines whether or not the process to run should be awaited for.<br />*When set to `false`, the task cannot wait for the process to complete and thus cannot output the process’s result.* Only available for workflows.<br />*Defaults to `true`.* |

## Container

:::info
Currently, this only supports Docker containers run via the `docker` binary on
your local machine. Additional container runtimes are planned - please upvote
[#181](https://github.com/mrsimonemms/zigflow/issues/181) to influence prioritsation.
:::

Enables the execution of external processes encapsulated within a containerised
environment, allowing workflows to interact with and execute complex operations
using containerised applications, scripts, or commands.

## Script

Enables the execution of custom scripts or code within a workflow, empowering
workflows to perform specialised logic, data processing, or integration tasks by
executing user-defined scripts written in various programming languages.

#### Supported languages

:::warning
The [Docker image](https://github.com/mrsimonemms/zigflow/blob/main/Dockerfile)
is built on the [`node:lts-alpine` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) and
installs the [`python3` Alpine package](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86/python3).
For specific versions of these languages, build your own image.
:::

This is a list of available languages and the command that is called.

| Language | Binary Target |
| :--- | :--- |
| `js` | `node` |
| `python` | `python` |

### Example {#script-example}

```yaml
document:
  dsl: 1.0.0
  namespace: zigflow
  name: example
  version: 0.0.1
do:
  - nodejs:
      export:
        as: '${ $context + { nodejs: . } }'
      run:
        script:
          language: js
          code: |
            const http = require('http');

            console.log(`${process.argv[2]} from ${process.env.NAME}`);

            console.log(http.STATUS_CODES);
          arguments:
            - Hello
          environment:
            NAME: js
  - python:
      output:
        as: '${ $context + { python: . } }'
      run:

                arg = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else ""

                name = os.getenv("NAME", "")

                print(f"{arg} from {name}")

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                main()
          arguments:
            - Hello
          environment:
            NAME: python
```

## Shell

## Workflow
