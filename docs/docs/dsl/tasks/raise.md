# Raise

Intentionally triggers and propagates errors. By employing the "Raise" task,
workflows can deliberately generate error conditions, allowing for explicit error
handling and fault management strategies to be implemented.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|:--|:---:|:---:|:---|
| raise.error | [`error`](#error) | `yes` | Defines the [error](#error) to raise. |

## Example

```yaml
document:
  dsl: 1.0.0
  namespace: zigflow
  name: example
  version: 0.0.1
timeout:
  after:
    minutes: 1
do:
  - wait:
      wait:
        seconds: 1
  - bug:
      raise:
        error:
          type: https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/communication
          status: 400
```

## Error

Defines the [Problem Details RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807)
compliant description of an error.

### Properties {#error-properties}

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|:----:|:--------:|-------------|
| type | `uri-template` | `yes` | A URI reference that identifies the [`error`](#error) type. <br />For cross-compatibility concerns, it is strongly recommended to use [Standard Error Types](#standard-error-types) whenever possible.<br />Runtimes **MUST** ensure that the property has been set when raising or escalating the [`error`](#error). |
| status | `integer` | `yes` | The status code generated by the origin for this occurrence of the [`error`](#error).<br />For cross-compatibility concerns, it is strongly recommended to use [HTTP Status Codes](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6) whenever possible.<br />Runtimes **MUST** ensure that the property has been set when raising or escalating the [`error`](#error). |
| instance | `string` | `no` | A [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) used to reference the component the [`error`](#error) originates from.<br />Runtimes **MUST** set the property when raising or escalating the [`error`](#error). Otherwise ignore. |
| title | `string` | `no` | A short, human-readable summary of the [`error`](#error) or a [runtime expression](intro#runtime-expressions) |
| detail | `string` | `no` | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the [`error`](#error) or a [runtime expression](intro#runtime-expressions) |

## Standard Error Types

Standard error types serve the purpose of categorizing errors consistently across
different runtimes, facilitating seamless migration from one runtime environment
to another.

| Type | Status[¹](#footnote-1) | Description |
|------|:-------:|-------------|
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/configuration](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/configuration) | `400` | Errors resulting from incorrect or invalid configuration settings, such as missing or misconfigured environment variables, incorrect parameter values, or configuration file errors. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/validation](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/validation) | `400` | Errors arising from validation processes, such as validation of input data, schema validation failures, or validation constraints not being met. These errors indicate that the provided data or configuration does not adhere to the expected format or requirements specified by the workflow. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/expression](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/expression) | `400` | Errors occurring during the evaluation of runtime expressions, such as invalid syntax or unsupported operations. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/authentication](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/authentication) | `401` | Errors related to authentication failures. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/authorization](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/authorization) | `403` | Errors related to unauthorized access attempts or insufficient permissions to perform certain actions within the workflow. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/timeout](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/timeout) | `408` | Errors caused by timeouts during the execution of tasks or during interactions with external services. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/communication](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/communication) | `500` | Errors  encountered while communicating with external services, including network errors, service unavailable, or invalid responses. |
| [https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/runtime](https://serverlessworkflow.io/spec/1.0.0/errors/runtime) | `500` | Errors occurring during the runtime execution of a workflow, including unexpected exceptions, errors related to resource allocation, or failures in handling workflow tasks. These errors typically occur during the actual execution of workflow components and may require runtime-specific handling and resolution strategies. |

<span id="footnote-1">¹</span> *Default value. The `status code` that best
describes the error should always be used.*
