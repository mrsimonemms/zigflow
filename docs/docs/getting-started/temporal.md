# Your Temporal Server

Zigflow works with all Temporal server types. [Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud)
is best for high-performance, production workflows and [Self-Hosted](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide)
is great for smaller workflows and development/testing.

For ease, this example uses the development server bundled with the
[Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli)

```sh
temporal server start-dev
```
