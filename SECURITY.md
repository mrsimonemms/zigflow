## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- The affected version(s) or commit(s)
- Steps to reproduce
- A proof of concept, exploit details or logs where possible

If you do not receive a response within that time, please follow up.

## What to Expect

After a report is received:

1. The issue will be reviewed and severity assessed.
2. Additional information may be requested.
3. If confirmed, a fix will be developed and released.
4. The vulnerability may be disclosed publicly once a fix is available.

Fix timelines depend on severity, complexity and maintainer availability.
There are no guaranteed remediation timelines.

Where appropriate, a CVE identifier may be requested and published for
confirmed vulnerabilities.

If a CVE is assigned:

- The CVE ID will be referenced in the security advisory

## Responsible Disclosure

Please:
